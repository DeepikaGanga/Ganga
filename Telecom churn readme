# Telecom_churn Ganga's
A csv file named telecom_churn_data was provided.
The data contains customers data like Outgoing and Incoming calls minutes of usage, mobile internet usage, Recharge amounts, Recharge numbers, etc for four months (i.e. June, July, August, September).
The objective of this project is to predict the churn in the last (i.e. September) month using the data (features) from the first three (i.e. June, July, August) months.
High-value customers were filtered.
A churn column was added based on the provided conditions and this churn column is our target variable.
Attributes containing data for last (i.e. September) month was removed.
Missing values were handled.
Splitted the dataset into train and test sets.
Handled class imbalance.
Feature scaling was done.
In this project a model was built using Logistic Regression model.
The strong predicter features were selected using RFE and VIF.
Plotted ROC curve to determine AUC value so that we can check the models performance.
Founded Optimal cutoff point by calculating accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for various probability cutoffs.
Again founded cutoff point using Precision-Recall curve.
After getting the cutoff point, the Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity for train set was calculated.
Made predictions on test set.
Visualized some plots for predictor variables.
In this way we found strong predictors of churn.
